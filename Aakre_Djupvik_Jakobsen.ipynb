    "and denote with for example 1 or 0 whether a monomer is located at a point in space or not. This will in general be \n",
    "unsuitable when scaling the problem, since the size of the matrix scales as $N^2$ with the size of the polymer. This also \n",
    "results in a higher computation time, because every computation done with the polymer requires iterating through the entire \n",
    "matrix. As most of the indices will be zero, this is a waste of space and time, and can be optimized.\n",

    "A more efficient way of representing the polymer is just to store its monomer coordinates in a $N\\times2$ matrix, reducing \n",
    "the matrix size to scale linearly with the size of the polymer. In our implementation the matrix has a size of $N\\times2$, \n",
    "where each row contains the coordinate of a single monomer, $(x, y)$. The order of the rows is set to be the order\n",
